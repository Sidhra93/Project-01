### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
---
#### Instructions

The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either player has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.

The requirements of the project were to;

- Render a game in the browser
- Design logic for winning and visual display of winner
- Include separate HTML, CSS and Javascript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation

---

I used a pseudeocode to approach the problem starting with the logic, and drawings to come up with a basic design. Starting with the logic of the game done in the console as planned, I continued on to include HTML and DOM manipulation to bring the game to life.

#### Cross browser

I tested the game on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Although it worked fine in Chrome and Firefox, it didn't function on Edge and IE.
